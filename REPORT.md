Issues:  
The CmpositeFactory project is not complete. I did not get as far as to reading in from a file and outputting to the file. I have made use of the composite pattern and the factory pattern. Ideally, my composite will call on the factory, giving it a name. The factory will then determine which shape to create based on what the name is and send it back where the elements will be set. My factory graphicCreator was not technically a factory, more of a precursor to the factory. I was going to break it up into an interface and a concrete but ran out of time.
